_Learning Outcome_

Through this project, I practiced:

Writing clean and structured HTML

Styling layouts using modern CSS

Using JavaScript for game logic

Handling user events (click, input, keyboard)

Manipulating the DOM dynamically

Storing data using localStorage

Organizing files for a small web project

RevoFun represents a step forward in learning web development by combining creativity, logic, and interactivity into a single project.
This project was created as a learning assignment.
While inspiration was taken from professional game studio websites, all code was written manually to ensure understanding of the core concepts.
